# DesignPatternsDemo

## Overview
The DesignPatternsDemo project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in .NET 8. Each design pattern is implemented in its respective directory with detailed examples and explanations. The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how these patterns can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Design Patterns Covered
1. **Abstract Factory**
2. **Builder**
3. **Bridge**
4. **Composite**
5. **Decorator**
6. **State**
7. **Visitor**

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have .NET 8 installed on your machine. You can run each design pattern example individually.

### Running an Example
Navigate to the specific pattern directory and run the example using the .NET CLI. For example, to run the Abstract Factory example:

```bash
cd DesignPatternsDemo/AbstractFactory
dotnet run
```
## Design Pattern Descriptions
### 1. Abstract Factory
   The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. Builder
   The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### 3. Bridge
   The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

### 4. Composite
   The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### 5. Decorator
   The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

### 6. State
   The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### 7. Visitor
   The Visitor pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
