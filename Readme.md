# DesignPatternsDemo

## Overview
The DesignPatternsDemo project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in .NET 8. Each design pattern is implemented in its respective directory with detailed examples and explanations. The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how these patterns can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Design Patterns Covered
1. **Abstract Factory**
2. **Builder**
3. **Bridge**
4. **Composite**
5. **Decorator**
6. **State**
7. **Visitor**

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have .NET 8 installed on your machine. You can run each design pattern example individually.

### Running an Example
Navigate to the specific pattern directory and run the example using the .NET CLI. For example, to run the Abstract Factory example:

```bash
cd DesignPatternsDemo/AbstractFactory
dotnet run
```
## Design Pattern Descriptions
### 1. Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is particularly useful when the exact types and dependencies of the objects need to be determined at runtime. By using this pattern, you can ensure that your code adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, promoting loose coupling.

### 2. Builder
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This is particularly useful when you need to create an object with many possible configurations. By using the Builder pattern, you can construct objects step by step, allowing for greater control over the construction process.

### 3. Bridge
The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. It helps in creating a scalable and maintainable codebase by allowing you to develop the abstraction and implementation independently.

### 4. Composite
The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful for creating complex structures that can be treated as a single entity, simplifying client code and promoting the Single Responsibility Principle.

### 5. Decorator
The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects without subclassing. By using decorators, you can extend the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable way, promoting the Open/Closed Principle.

### 6. State
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state. By using the State pattern, you can encapsulate state-specific behavior and separate it from the main class, promoting the Single Responsibility Principle.

### 7. Visitor
The Visitor pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. This pattern is useful when you need to perform operations on a group of similar kinds of objects. By using the Visitor pattern, you can define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates, promoting the Open/Closed Principle.
